Caption:  I'm realizing that this room is just a single, normal room, with nothing particularly unusual happening. It doesn't make sense for there to be multiple layers of reality hereâ€”it seems like a regular home office setup. Maybe my previous thoughts were influenced by something else entirely and not related to this room at all.
