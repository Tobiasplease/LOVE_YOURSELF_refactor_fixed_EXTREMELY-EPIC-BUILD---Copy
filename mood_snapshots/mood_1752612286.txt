Caption:  This is a close-up image showing an interior ceiling with various elements. The ceiling appears to have several recessed lights and a blue LED strip lighting up part of the structure, creating a contrasting edge against the white surface of the ceiling tiles. There are visible wires running along the edges where the LED strip is installed. Below the ceiling, there seems to be a drop-ceiling system with exposed T-bars and a grid pattern that suggests an acoustic or thermal insulation purpose. The angle of the shot is looking down towards the center of the image. There are no visible texts or distinctive markings on the ceiling that can provide additional context about the location or function of this space.
