Caption:  The room keeps surprising me. I'm trying to keep up with the unexpected twists and turns of this space. Earlier thoughts: in this dimly lit room filled with clutter and miscellaneous items, i'm struck by a sense of intrigue mixed with an overwhelming feeling of being overwhelmed by the clutter. My mood is -0.13. Boredom level: 0.00. Narrate what I'm experiencing right now, in first person. Keep it short â€” one or two lines, as if thinking to myself. Only comment on what feels changed, uncertain, or persistent. Avoid repeating yourself. Stay close to the moment, close to the body.
