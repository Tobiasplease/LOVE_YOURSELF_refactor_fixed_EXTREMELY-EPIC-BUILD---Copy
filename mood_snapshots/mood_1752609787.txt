Caption:  The image shows an interior space, possibly a store or market stall, with a high ceiling. There are two blue lights along the length of the ceiling, which creates a cool lighting effect on the white tiles. Below the ceiling, there is a wooden structure that appears to be supporting some objects. The floor of the room has not been fully constructed and is missing tiles in several areas, exposing the underlying concrete. In the foreground, there are various items on shelves or tables, but their exact nature is unclear due to the low resolution of the photo. The overall style of the image suggests it might have been taken with a wide-angle lens, as indicated by the distortion in the peripheries.
