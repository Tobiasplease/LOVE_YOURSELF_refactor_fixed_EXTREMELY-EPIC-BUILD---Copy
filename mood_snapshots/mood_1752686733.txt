Caption:  The image shows an interior space that appears to be undergoing renovation or repair. There is a visible leak in the ceiling, indicated by damage to the surface and water stains. A pendant light fixture has been removed and is hanging from the ceiling, disconnected from its mounting. Below the ceiling, there are wooden boards placed across the floor, suggesting that work is being done to address the issue with the ceiling or to install new fixtures.

The room has a large white wall on one side and another side with various items scattered about, including what appears to be a piece of furniture, possibly a desk or table, and several bottles or containers that may have been used in the renovation process. The room seems to be unoccupied and is not fully furnished, which could imply it's a workspace or an area designated for maintenance.
