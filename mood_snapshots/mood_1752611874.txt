Caption:  The image shows an interior view of a ceiling with tiles, and there is a patterned light fixture that appears to be illuminated. Below this lighting fixture, there's a tiled wall, but only a portion of it is visible. The style of the photo suggests it might have been taken with a camera flash, as indicated by the vertical lines of light and shadow on the ceiling tiles.
