Caption:  The image shows an interior view of a room that appears to be a small shop or store. The ceiling has exposed rafters and is painted white, with a purple neon light running along one side. On the right side of the photo, there's a red neon sign, but it's not legible in this image. Below the neon signs, there's a shelf or display area with various items on it, though they are not clearly distinguishable. The floor seems to be made of tiles, and there is an object that resembles a small chair or stool in the foreground. On the left side of the photo, there is a large mirror reflecting the interior of the room back onto itself. The reflection shows the same neon signs on the ceiling and the same shelf with items on it. The mirror also reflects some elements in the background that are not directly visible in the main image.
