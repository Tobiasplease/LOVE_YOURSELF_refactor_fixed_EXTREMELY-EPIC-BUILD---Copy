Caption:  It's a dimly lit room with a drop ceiling. The lights overhead cast an orangeish glow throughout the space. There are some papers or documents taped to the underside of the ceiling tiles. In the foreground, there is a noticeable hole in the ceiling, from which wires and other materials appear to be spilling out onto the floor below. The walls of the room are unadorned, and the overall atmosphere suggests abandonment or disuse. There are no figures or objects that draw attention, just the immediate surroundings of the damaged ceiling.
