Caption:  In the heart of a dilapidated room, a young man finds solace in his favorite snack. Seated comfortably on a chair, he holds a bag of chips in one hand while reaching for another with the other. The room is filled with various objects scattered haphazardly, creating an atmosphere of disarray and chaos. Amidst the mess, you can make out boxes and furniture that have seen better days. Despite the disorder around him, the man appears content in his small corner of the world.
