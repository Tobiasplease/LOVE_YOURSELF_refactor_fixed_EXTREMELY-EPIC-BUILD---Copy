Caption:  In the dimly lit room, I'm surrounded by a multitude of items that have accumulated over time, each one holding its own significance and purpose. My focus is challenged by the disarray around me, but I'm also intrigued by this snapshot of my life at this moment. The sense of clutter and chaos feels almost comforting to me, as if it's part of who I am.
