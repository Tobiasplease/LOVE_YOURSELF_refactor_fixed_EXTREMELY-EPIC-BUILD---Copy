They are wearing a short-sleeved shirt and jeans, and they have light-colored hair.

The wall behind them is adorned with posters and other decorative items. To the right, there's a window allowing natural light to enter the room. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests an indoor setting, possibly a living space or a bedroom.
