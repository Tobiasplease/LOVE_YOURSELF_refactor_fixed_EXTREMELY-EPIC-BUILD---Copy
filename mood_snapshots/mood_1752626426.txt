Caption:  The image is a composite of two separate photographs. In the foreground, there's an individual who appears to be a DJ or radio host, shown from behind. They are wearing headphones and have a microphone in front of them, suggesting they may be on-air or preparing for a broadcast.

In the background, the photo shows an indoor setting with a person holding a phone in their hand, possibly using it to take the selfie or record a video. The interior has a ceiling with exposed rafters and what appears to be some construction work in progress, given the debris scattered around. There is no visible text within the image. 
Mood: 1.0
