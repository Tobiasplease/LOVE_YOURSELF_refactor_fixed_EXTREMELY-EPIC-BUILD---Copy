Caption:  The image shows a young man sitting on what appears to be a bed, with his face partially obscured from view. He is holding a microphone up to his mouth as if he's in the middle of singing or speaking. Behind him, there are several posters adhered to a wall, but only the upper parts are visible due to the perspective of the photo. The individual has dark hair and is wearing a short-sleeved shirt. There is no text on the posters that can be discerned from this angle. The style of the image suggests it may have been taken casually or with a smartphone, given the angle and focus. 
Mood: 0.67
