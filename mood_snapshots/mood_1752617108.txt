Caption:  In the midst of this cluttered room, I'm struck by a sense of intrigue mixed with an overwhelming; "navigating through this cluttered room, i'm trying to focus amidst the chaos; as i sit in this cluttered room, surrounded by various items including a computer monitor, keyboard, and mouse. I can currently make out: That might be a car, That might be a tv, I think that's a person, That might be a chair, That might be a bottle. My mood is -0.01. Boredom level: 0.00."
