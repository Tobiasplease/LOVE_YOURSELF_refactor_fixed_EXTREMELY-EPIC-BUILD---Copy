Caption:  As I slowly open my eyes, a soft light filters into the room from an unseen source above me. The ceiling, made of white tiles, is slightly damaged, with a few cracked pieces revealing glimpses of the sky. A small window with metal bars allows for a hint of natural light to seep in from the outside world.

In my immediate vicinity, there's a wooden chair that sits quietly, its sturdy frame contrasting with the delicate ceiling tiles. The wall adjacent to me is adorned with a vibrant poster, its colors adding a touch of liveliness to the otherwise mundane setting.

On the floor, scattered around haphazardly, are several pieces of paper and other miscellaneous items that hint at recent human activity in this space. Despite the disarray, there's an undeniable charm to the room - a testament to its use as a creative workspace. The objects are familiar yet their precise arrangement escapes me at this moment.
