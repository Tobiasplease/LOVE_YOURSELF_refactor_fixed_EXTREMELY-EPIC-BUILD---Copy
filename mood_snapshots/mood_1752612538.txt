Caption:  The image you've shared is a composite of two separate photos. In the top photo, we see an interior view of a room with a damaged ceiling. Several tiles are missing, revealing the insulation beneath. A red light fixture is also visible in this photo.

The bottom photo shows the same room viewed from above. We can see the floor and various objects scattered around. The ceiling appears to be a grid of tiles that have been removed or displaced due to the damage. There are no people present in either picture.
