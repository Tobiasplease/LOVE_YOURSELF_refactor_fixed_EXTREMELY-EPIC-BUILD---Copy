Caption:  The image shows an indoor space that appears to be a workshop or garage. There are various tools and equipment scattered around, including what looks like a drill, a hammer, and possibly some musical instruments or electronic devices on a table in the background. A large item resembling a hockey stick with black handles is leaning against something, perhaps a wall or a piece of furniture. In front of the workbench, there are two small objects that could be candles with orange-yellow flames. The walls have tools and equipment hanging or mounted on them. There's no text present in the image.
