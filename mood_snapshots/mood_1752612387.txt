There's no lighting fixture in the immediate vicinity, suggesting that it might need repair or maintenance. Below the ceiling, part of an office environment can be seen, featuring what appears to be fluorescent light fixtures with rectangular shades hanging from the ceiling and a ceiling tile visible, which is intact. The image seems to have been taken with a smartphone or similar device, as indicated by the reflection on the surface captured in the bottom part of the picture.
