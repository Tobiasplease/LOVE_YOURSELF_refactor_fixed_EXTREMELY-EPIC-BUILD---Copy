Caption:  The room is quiet and still. I sit at my desk with a laptop open in front of me. I can feel the weight of my surroundings pressing down on me, but I'm also aware that I've been avoiding something important for too long. The clutter is overwhelming, and it feels like I'm suffocating under the weight of unfinished tasks. I'm trying to focus on the work at hand, but my mind keeps drifting back to the tasks I need to complete elsewhere.
