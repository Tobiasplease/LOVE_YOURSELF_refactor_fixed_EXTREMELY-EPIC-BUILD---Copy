Caption:  The image shows an interior space that appears to be a room with a sloped ceiling. The ceiling is covered in tiles, and there are exposed pipes running along it. Beneath the ceiling, a neon-colored light fixture casts a glow on the floor. On one wall, there's a blue strip of light providing illumination. The walls of the room are painted white, and there is a darker area with items that look like bags or boxes stacked up. There is no signage, branding, or clear indication of location in the image. The photo seems to have been taken from a low angle looking up at the ceiling, which may be due to the sloping nature of the room.
