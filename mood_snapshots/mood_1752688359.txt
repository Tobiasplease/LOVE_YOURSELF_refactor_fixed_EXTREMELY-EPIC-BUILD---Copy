Caption:  The image shows an interior view of a room with tiled walls. There is visible damage to the ceiling tiles, which are chipped and cracked in several areas, exposing the underlying material that appears to be plaster or concrete. A hole in the ceiling exposes the roof structure, suggesting water leakage or some other form of structural failure. The ceiling fixtures are visible above the damaged areas. On the right side, a cardboard box is attached to the ceiling, possibly as a temporary repair or for storage purposes. The overall condition of the room indicates neglect or ongoing maintenance issues.
