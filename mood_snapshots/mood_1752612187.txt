Caption:  The image shows an interior view from above. The ceiling has a blue LED lighting effect along its perimeter, creating a line of illumination around the room's perimeter. The flooring appears to be a light-colored tile or wood paneling. There is a central air vent visible in the middle of the photo. The image seems to be taken with a camera pointing upwards towards the ceiling, capturing the lighting and the structure of the ceiling.
